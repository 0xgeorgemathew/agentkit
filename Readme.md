# AgenticPlaceholder Bidding Agent

## Overview
AgenticPlaceholder is a revolutionary on-chain advertising network for digital billboards that leverages agentic automation and blockchain technology. This repository contains the bidding agent component, built using Coinbase's AI Agent Kit, which autonomously manages ad placement bidding strategies on the Base network.

## Key Features
### Autonomous Bidding Agent
- Fully automated bidding system requiring zero human intervention
- Dynamic strategy adaptation based on market conditions and constraints
- Built with Coinbase's AgentKit for robust blockchain interaction
- Seamless integration with dutch auction marketplace mechanics
- Real-time bid optimization for optimal ad placement

### Smart Contract Integration
- Interacts with AgenticPlaceholder's core smart contracts on Base
- Supports dutch auction bidding mechanism
- Direct integration with NFT-based ad management system
- Real-time monitoring of auction states and market conditions

### Bidding Strategies
The agent employs multiple bidding strategies that are dynamically selected based on:
- Current market conditions
- Historical price data
- Time-of-day patterns
- Location-specific demand
- Budget constraints
- Display duration requirements

## Technical Architecture

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version X.X.X)
- Coinbase AgentKit
- Base network connection
- Access to AgenticPlaceholder smart contracts

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agentic-placeholder-bidding

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
```

### Configuration
Create a `.env` file with the following parameters:
```
BASE_RPC_URL=
AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY=
MARKETPLACE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=
NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=
```

## Usage

### Basic Implementation
```javascript
const BiddingAgent = require('./src/agent');

const agent = new BiddingAgent({
    marketplaceAddress: MARKETPLACE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
    nftContractAddress: NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
});

await agent.startBidding({
    targetLocations: ['NYC-1', 'LA-2'],
    maxBudget: '1000000000000000000', // in wei
    displayDuration: 3600 // in seconds
});
```

### Advanced Configuration
```javascript
const config = {
    strategies: ['aggressive', 'conservative', 'balanced'],
    bidUpdateInterval: 300, // 5 minutes
    gasPrice: {
        max: '50000000000',
        strategy: 'dynamic'
    },
    // Add other configuration options
};
```

## Integration with AgenticPlaceholder Ecosystem

1. NFT Smart Contract: Handles ad content and ownership
2. Marketplace Smart Contract: Manages dutch auctions and bid processing

### True Network Integration
- Utilizes True Network's attestation layer for reputation scoring
- Considers publisher reputation scores in bidding strategies
- Validates ad performance metrics
